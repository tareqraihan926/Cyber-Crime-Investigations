## Case Scenario

<p align="justify">The Jabulani twin brothers, Arnos and John Jabulani, were in charge of an organized international animal trafficking network that was based in Capetown, South Africa. In order to ensure the success of their illegal scheme, they used violence and corruption. They exchanged a lot of emails and communicated on social media to set up drop-off locations with their clients all over the world to smuggle animals. However, the Arnos brothers and the freight company exchanged numerous emails to discuss prices for renting vans and lorries of various sizes in order to transport the animals safely and ensure that they arrive at their destination alive. They receive the animals precisely at the designated time and place and deal with guns, weapons, lorries, and vans for poachers. Additionally, they use steganography techniques to conceal the files containing the supporting evidence. These techniques include image and audio steganography, password encryption, and background hidden text in plain docx files. This case's evidence files provide support for the claim, and each is linked to the evidence.</p>
