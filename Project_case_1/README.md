<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>

Offender Hide some secret data in a docx file by encrypting to a hash code like base64 format.
After decode the hash found that text “Child sexual exploitation refers to the sexual abuse of a
person below the age of 18, as well as to the production of images of such abuse and the
sharing of those images online”. We clarify that they are planning to share the abuse images of
a child to social media platform.


<b>Description of the hiding/unhiding process:</b><br><br>

Hide the characters in a docs file by a white background. Basically when it is opened then it can
view by blank but mark the page and change the colour then we found the text that is hash
value like base64. We decode from base64 decoder.

Offender Used the steganography technique for hide some secret data that is related to
Grooming of a child & Abusement. The extracted message is

This is a morse code adaptive audio for some plain text messages. We hide a readable message

<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>
Finally we noticed that this is the offender image and information. But the image is being
corrupted. We need to correct it. Here is, they do the file signature change for hide the real
image. This is a offenders jpg image but not opened. So after correct the header signature of
jpg file then it will opened. And we got it our offenders image.

<b>Description of the hiding/unhiding process:</b><br><br>

<p align="center">
<b>File Signature Correction</b><br><br>
</p>
For the “Catch me” jpg fle, we showed that the fle does not open due to a
signature or extension mismatched. This image extension we show that
it's a jpg fle but not opened. Using HxD tools, we can open it to check the
signature with a detailed hex view with ascii value. After Open in HxD,<br>

Check the fle header signature.<br>

We noticed that the hex value ended with FF D9.<br>

And start with some wrong hex like this.<br>
<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/tareqraihan926/Digital-Forensics-Cyber-Crime-Investigations/blob/main/Project_case_1/Screenshots/Screenshot%20from%202023-03-15%2018-23-12.png" width="" height="">
</p>

But also we can see that its start JFIF in ascii section & ended by hex FF
D9. That means it's a jpg fle. Extension is correct. But the signature is
incorrect, that's why this is not open.
We know that the Jpg fle header signature starts from FF D8 FF E0
sequence. So we will correct from the beginning. And save it. Then it
will be open.<br>

<p align="center"
<b>File Extension Correction</b><br><br>
</p>

For stegano fle we can see that it's an unknown fle. By open in HxD.<br>

<p align="center">

<img src="https://github.com/tareqraihan926/Digital-Forensics-Cyber-Crime-Investigations/blob/main/Project_case_1/Screenshots/Screenshot%20from%202023-03-15%2018-23-27.png" width="" height="">
</p>

Hex starts from 50 4B 03 04 that means it's a zip fle. Zip fle header is 50
4B 03 04. so , we need to rename the fle from stegano.sc to stegano.zip.
Then it will be corrected and will open.<br>

<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>

In this section we found a notes text file that is define that a child abused image have in
offender. We found the image zip file that is password protected. Offender hide the image in a
zip file by password protect. Notes file define us that the zip file password can be found from
chats. So from the leaked social media chats section we found the pass and using this password
we extracted the image files. That can prove against offender by a strong proof.<br>

<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>

In this section, after extracted the zip file we found a image that is related to sign language.
That means another some secret message encoded in sign language. Using
https://www.dcode.fr/american-sign-language this site we convert the sign language to plain
text.<br>

<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>
In this section we dounf a link.txt file that is binary text. We will use a online decoder for this
binary then we found a link that is related with Online child sexual exploitation and abuse.

 <b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>
 
 In this section we will found victim original name. we found a image file named victim.png but
its also not opened. But here we found a another image file that is related to this victim.png
file. We noticed that victim.png file string compromised by this encase. So we notice that in the
strings section have some hash txt like base64. We collect it and decode as same method as
followed in previous. Then finally we found the victim original name. The extracted name or
test is: “ Victim Name: Nuria Lora” <br>


 <b>Description of the hiding/unhiding process:</b><br><br>
 
 Victim.png file corrupted by ASCII conversion. That means we need to check its strings.

 We can see that here is a hash value. Collect this hash and decode it. Then we found the text.<br>

 ## 6. Personal Reflection
 
 ## 6.1 Student 
 
 <b>6.1.1 Reflection</b><br><br>
Child Protection Policy is very need in this time. Digital crime is the most common factors for
this time & child can easily the target by the social media. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.2 Strengths/major contributions to the group</b><br><br>
 
 Completed the full Project on Child Protection Digital Crime Scenario make and Investigation on this. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.3 What you found enjoyable</b><br><br>
 
 Data Encryption for Data Hiding. Most of Steganography Techniques Like morse and the other section is sign language.<br>
 
 <b>6.1.4 What was challenging</b><br><br>
 
 File Signeture Mismathce checking and Correction. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.5 Technical challenges and outcomes</b><br><br>
 
 Encase Forensics Imager is not free version, is premium. I am use Access Data FTK Imager for create the crime scenario evidence .E01 file. That was techniqal challenge for me. The outcome is it can be done easily by Encase Forensics but that is not available in every section like Not Open Source. So Its need to be Open source file. <br>
