<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

An thief steal a sports car without the owner's knowledge. They used a target person as a
victim to demonstrate the responsible party. The thief and their group hack the victim's phone
in order to obtain his credit card information. Without knowing the victim, they purchase a
sports car from a website run by a sports car selling authority using the victim's credit card
information. We infiltrated and confiscated the offender's device, and from his bootable
pendrive, we retrieved some evidence to support our claims. We seize the pendrive in order
to substantiate this case about the thieves' theft of the victim's sports automobile.

<!-- 2. Legislation Analysis -->
## 2. Legislation Analysis
## 2.1 Legislation
Motor vehicle theft, as defined by the Federal Bureau of Investigation
(FBI), is the taking or attempted taking of a motor vehicle without the

propelled, land-based, non-rail vehicle. This excludes watercraft,
airplanes, farm machinery, bulldozers, and construction tools.

## 2.2 Points to prove

A target victim acknowledge by offender by hacked his phone & stealing a sports car using
victim credit card.

## 2.3 What the Digital Forensics case can prove

This Digital Forensics case can prove that who is the victim, who is the offender & which member
included with real offender.

## 2.4 What the Digital Forensics case will not prove

This Digital Forensics Case does not prove the exact location address of the offenders.

## 2.5 Highlight any artefacts that undermine the prosecution’s case.

Here is social media chat between Sports car authority & offender that can prove, offender

<b>Description and implications of the artefact:</b><br><br>

Finally we noticed that this is the offender image and information. But the image is being
corrupted. We need to correct it. Here is, they do the file signature change for hide the real
image. This is a offenders jpg image but not opened. So after correct the header signature of
jpg file then it will opened. And we got it our offenders image.<br>

<b>File Signature Correction</b><br><br>
</p>

For the “Partner & Its_me” jpg file, we showed that the file does not open due to a signature
or extension mismatched. This image extension we show that it's a jpg file but not opened.
Using HxD tools, we can open it to check the signature with a detailed hex view with ascii
value. After Open in HxD, Check the file header signature.<br><br>
We noticed that the hex value ended with FF D9.

In this section we found a notes text file & a zip file for password protectied that is define
that a client information. We found the image zip file that is password protected. Offender
hide the image in a zip file by password protect. Notes file define us that the zip file password
can be found from chats like car model number. That can prove against offender by a strong proof.<br>

In this section we will found stealing sports car planning date by the offende & their partner.
we found a image file named plan-date.png but its also not opened. But here we found a
another text file that is related to this png file. We noticed that plan-date.png file string
compromised by this encase. So we notice that in the strings section have some hash txt like
base64. We collect it and decode as same method as followed in previous. Then finally we
found the Plan date of the sports car stealing.<br>

about sports car stealing.<br>

 <!-- 6. Personal Reflection -->
 ## 6. Personal Reflection
 
 ## 6.1 Student 
 
 <b>6.1.1 Reflection</b><br><br>
Digital crime stealing services is very bad things in this time. Digital crime is the most
common factors for this time & victim can easily the target by the social media or hacked by
phising. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.2 Strengths/major contributions to the group</b><br><br>
 
 Completed the full Project on Digital Crime Scenario make and Investigation on this. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.3 What you found enjoyable</b><br><br>
 
 Data Encryption for Data Hiding. Most of Steganography Techniques Like morse and the
other section is sign language.<br>
 
 <b>6.1.4 What was challenging</b><br><br>
 
File Signeture Mismatch checking and Correction. <br>
 
 <b>6.1.5 Technical challenges and outcomes</b><br><br>
 
 Encase Forensics Imager is not free version, is premium. I am use Access Data FTK Imager
for create the crime scenario evidence .E01 file. That was techniqal challenge for me. The
outcome is it can be done easily by Encase Forensics but that is not available in every section
like Not Open Source. So Its need to be Open source file. <br>
